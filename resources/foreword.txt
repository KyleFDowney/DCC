Diabolic is a dice-based role-playing game platform designed with visualization and immersion in top priority. This system intends to create a “physics engine” usable by wondrous interactive fantasy worlds within the mind of one person (the Director) to be “played” by others. An optimal game would be hosted by one Director and about four to six players who are joined together in one party. Within this manual are numerous in-depth explanations and tables designed to be used as helpful guidelines rather than concrete rules. The ultimate goal of this system is to provide an imaginative and fun experience for both the Director and his Players with lax rules for optimal enjoyment. People with good improvisational and role-playing experience are well equipped to fill the role of the Director granted that they have the drive to hold the responsibility that is being in absolute control of their game - while still allowing for fair game-play. The Director may break every rule in this book and still host an enjoyable game for all.

Diabolic can be adapted for use in many Medieval Fantasy worlds, allowing for a simplified yet expanded experience in old and new game worlds alike.
